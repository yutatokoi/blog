I went to an electronics store to help my mother choose a Windows laptop.

The whole process made me verbalise why I like buying and using Apple devices. I'm saving on cognitive resources.

I don’t want to have to think about differences between so many manufacturers, brands, and models. I don’t want to have to think about the options that are available for something as basic as Microsoft 365 (whether to buy the one-time license or the subscription).

It's also why I don't use Linux, despite getting paid to write software, and despite appreciating their philosophies. I want my computer to work for me, not me having to work for my computer.

Cognitive resources are limited. They can provide huge upside in your life, and prevent you from making bad decisions as well. 

This is a matter of preference. For some people, the software they want may not even be available on Mac. They may like the process of looking at the catalogue of available devices and sift through to find the one that best matches their needs. They may enjoy distro-hopping and figuring out the quirks of each one.

It's just about what to prioritise, and I like to prioritise saving my mental resources.
