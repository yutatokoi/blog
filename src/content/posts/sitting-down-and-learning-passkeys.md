(WIP: this article is a draft)

When services suggested I set up a passkey, I had been declining, because I didn't know how they worked under the hood. I don't want to add unncessary complexity to authentication when I've already got adept at using password generators and password managers.

But since enrolling in the [information security and privacy subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/subjects/info30006) at university, I've had more exposure to them. A member in my group is an extensive passkey user, and a guest lecturer mentioned that passkeys are more secure and easier. So it seems like a good opportunity as ever to finally sit down and determine for myself, whether this is something I want to switch to.


## Implementations

They differ.

## Backups (that are platform agnostic)

I like independence from platforms and companies. They come and go, and I don't want to rely on something as fragile as them for such a critical function.
