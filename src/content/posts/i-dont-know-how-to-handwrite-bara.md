"薔薇" is the Japanese kanji that reads "bara" and it means rose.

I also don't know how to write "檸檬", which means lemon.

Does it matter I can't handwrite these two words?

Not really. If I ever do need to handwrite the two words above, I can just write them in their katakana form. The meaning gets across just fine, and their katakana forms are rather common. For digital writing, I just type in their hiragana form and go through the suggested conversions to find their kanji representation.

Ever since I last took a Japanese class 5 years ago, I have rarely had to handwrite anything for that matter. And so it's the same for other words too.

All I need to know is just how to read their kanji form. Then, I can write type them out in hiragana, and wait for the list of conversion suggestions to do the job. If I really do need to handwrite a kanji I can't recall, I can type it out and use the kanji on screen as a reference.

The kanji for a word is just the form that is given to that word by society. This is similar to programming syntax. Any program could just be represented with [only whitespace characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29).

With LLMs getting better and better at coding, maybe we will not need to know how to write programming languages off of the top of our head.

To play devil's advocate though, I am likely susceptive to being tricked when typing out difficult kanji. If one of the smaller strokes in the kanji for rose (薔薇) was missing, I probably wouldn't notice it.

Similarly, I'd likely not notice a minor syntactic error for a programming language which I have not much mastery in.

But compilers (or linters or what have you) just catch those mistakes for us.

What we do need to know is the semantics of the program we want to write.

If we get an LLM today to write out Quicksort, it's likely to be incorrect or inefficient. Compilers don't catch that for us, so we need to know the idea of how Quicksort works. The syntax to implement that with a specific programming language is a separate skill.
