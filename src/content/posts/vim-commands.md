This will just be a cotinuously updated list of Vim keys/motions/commands I found by accident, mostly through mis-clicks, and sometimes by reading the friendly manual.

- `S`
    - Delete line and start insert (can have number prepended to delete `n` lines)
    - <https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#S>
- `SHIFT` + `k`
    - When pressed in visual mode over a keyword, brings you to help documentation for that keyword
    - <https://medium.com/code-art/vim-powerful-shift-k-748fec296319>
- `Ctrl` + `r`
    - Redo
